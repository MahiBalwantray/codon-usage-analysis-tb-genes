# Codon Usage Analysis of Tuberculosis Resistance Genes

This project analyzes the **codon usage bias** in three key *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* antibiotic resistance genes: **katG**, **inhA**, and **rpoB**. Codon usage can reflect evolutionary adaptations and can impact gene expression efficiency, which is crucial for understanding bacterial resistance mechanisms.

## 🔬 Genes Analyzed
- **katG** – associated with isoniazid resistance
- **inhA** – also related to isoniazid resistance
- **rpoB** – associated with rifampicin resistance

## 📁 Files in This Project
- `katG.fasta.txt`, `inhA.fasta.txt`, `rpoB.fasta.txt` – input gene sequences
- `codon_usage_analysis_tb_genes.ipynb` – main Jupyter Notebook
- `katG_codon_usage.csv`, etc. – codon frequency data
- `katG_codon_usage.png`, etc. – codon usage plots

## 📊 Output
- **Bar plots** showing the frequency of each codon used per gene
- **CSV tables** of codon frequencies

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Biopython
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Sequence parsing and analysis
- Codon-level frequency calculation
- Visualization with Matplotlib
- Automation for multi-gene analysis

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install required packages: `biopython`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`
2. Run the Jupyter notebook `codon_usage_analysis_tb_genes.ipynb`
